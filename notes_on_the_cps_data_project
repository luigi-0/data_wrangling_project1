Notes on the cps data project.

The codebook has been parsed and cleaned up significantly.

So far one unit test has been created to ensure all the variables are
being imported.

A script has been created to use the parsed codebook and a file containing
the variables of interest in order to import the desired cps dataset.

TODO:

-Think of more unit tests for the codebook parser

-Work on refactoring all the scripts

-Find a way to unit test the data extractor
